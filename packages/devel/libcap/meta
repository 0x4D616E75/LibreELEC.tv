PKG_LONGDESC="As of Linux 2.2.0, the power of the superuser has been partitioned into a set of discrete capabilities (in other places, these capabilities are know as privileges). The contents of the libcap package are a library and a number of simple programs that are intended to show how an application/daemon can be protected (with wrappers) or rewritten to take advantage of this fine grained approach to constraining the danger to your system from programs running as 'root'."
