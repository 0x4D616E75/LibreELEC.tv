PKG_SHORTDESC="attr: Extended Attributes Of Filesystem Objects"
PKG_LONGDESC="Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated perma- nently with files and directories, similar to the environ- ment strings associated with a process. An attribute may be defined or undefined. If it is defined, its value may be empty or non-empty. Extended attributes are extensions to the normal attributes which are associated with all inodes in the system (i.e. the stat(2) data). They are often used to provide additional functionality to a filesystem - for example, additional security features such as Access Con- trol Lists (ACLs) may be implemented using extended attributes."
