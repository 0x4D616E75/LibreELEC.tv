PKG_LONGDESC="LZMA utils in a nutshell. Average compression ratio of LZMA is about 30% better than that of gzip, and 15% better than that of bzip2. Decompression speed is only little slower than that of gzip, being two to five times faster than bzip2. In fast mode, compresses faster than bzip2 with a comparable compression ratio. However achieving the best compression ratios takes four to even twelve times longer than with bzip2. However, this doesn't affect decompressing speed."
